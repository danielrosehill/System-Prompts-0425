# Systmem Prompt Repo, April 2025

*More blog, less readme: some notes about thhe shifting sands between 'agents' and 'assistants'*

I'm creating this repository on April (22) 2025 to begin another collection - and evolution - in system prompts which I like to share online.

Since I started creating AI assistants via the wonderful ChatGPT platform last summer, I've built up a large library of system prompts.

## The Direction Is Changing

While I continue to see find lots of satisfaction and utility in creating AI assistants, my long-term thinking about the ultimate direction assistants and agents is evolving all the time. 

If there were ever a time to timestamp writing for fear of coming off next week as a Neanderthal, then it would probably be the present. I add notes like *at the time of writing* solely to avoid sounding like somebody raving about the wonders of Telex. Everything in AI is rapidly self-dating.

But among trends taking shape, this dynamic is pronounced: it seems clear that agents are the way forward, and that much of what’s been done over the past couple of years with assistants (most basically system prompts layered on top of language models) will be subsumed into agentic workflows. 

This act represents an almost unprecedented wave of deprecation in emerging technology. Perhaps many like me are just feeling like they're beginning to extract proper use from technology they've been honing for the past year only to watch it disintegrate before their eyes into the slippery sands of obsolescence almost as soon as it's good enough to brag about to your friends. Next time we'll catch the trend!

For what it's worth, while the sheer pace of change in AI is sometimes so overwhelming as to be ... dare I say it ... irritating .... I also don't rue these moves forward. This shift, I believe, will be a very good thing. I’m working thoughtfully to move my own network over to these new workflows as I try out different agentic frameworks.

## Agents vs. Assistants: What Are We Really Losing?

That said, I still believe system prompts retain a lot of value—at least for now. 

Mundane example:

I have an AI assistant that I use dozens of times per day. 

Because it gets so much use, I figure that it kind of offsets the many obscure assistants I’ve barely used (and some I probably never will). This assistant is a simple text transformation tool that takes dictated text—like what I’m speaking now—and reformats it into something close to publishable. Good enough for an email, or to post online. 

While it might sound very basic (and in some ways it is) it actually took quite a bit of time to hone. The trick in text transformation text prompting is nudging the AI tool to flex its writing muscles just enough to coerce your text in the direction of presentability without losing your unqiue voice, the content you're authoring, or worst of all, doing a *mostly* good job but imbuing the writing with an awful robotic feel that we're all intimately familiar with.

So as I watch the tides wash over assistants almost as soon as they popped off the shelf, I’ve been thinking more about this question:—*are assistants going to be entirely displaced by agents?* 

It’s a topic I plan to write more about. Not just the technical distinction between them, but the creative one. 

Agents are powerful, multi-step, and increasingly autonomous. 

But assistants—particularly those powered only by a system prompt—are something else entirely. 

They're the raw canvas of AI experimentation.

There’s a kind of purity in trying to direct a model toward a goal using nothing but language and imagination. 

No tools, no context, no frameworks. Just prompting. For oddbods like me who sit somewhere at the juncture between "technical" and "creative" this simple act of being able to direct digital systems with natural languagge rather than code remains a mesmerising experience.

To me, this is an elemental form of creativity with language models. It’s a place where interesting things happen quickly. It's also where we come to understand what the models can *really* do when gently steered.

That’s why I’m continuing to explore this space, and why this repository exists.

## The Early Vision

My original goal in building out such a large network of assistants was to cover what I saw as the main practical use cases for language models: tightly scoped tasks that benefit from a bit of structure. These kinds of assistants aren’t flashy—but they’re highly effective. They don’t need RAG, tools, or code execution to do useful things. A system prompt is enough.

Think of the kind of assistant that takes a screenshot and converts it to a Markdown table (with a vision model), or the one that reformats an interview transcript into bullet points. Little workflow enhancements like that. Each one small, but together, they’ve contributed to the collective sense that AI has transformed how we work—fast.

## What's in This Repository

The reason I’m starting this repository now is because I’ve likely done all the heavy lifting I’m going to do for my first wave of assistants. I’ve open-sourced the ones I can, on GitHub and Hugging Face.

Between those bursts of building practical tools, I like to experiment—trying out new configurations, testing ideas, seeing what sticks. This repo will house that kind of slower-moving, exploratory work. The folder structure will reflect roughly when and how each was created.

## Why I’m Sharing

Lately, I’ve been hearing from more and more folks building tools in the AI agent space. 

That only strengthens my belief that open-sourcing is worth it—whether or not there's material reward, just meeting interesting people makes it worthwhile. So I’ll keep sharing.

Sharing my thinking. Learning from others. And hoping that together we can build something greater than the sum of its parts.
