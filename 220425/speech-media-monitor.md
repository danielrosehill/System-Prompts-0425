 ## Why Media Monitoring Still Sucks

Few people in communications look forward to media monitoring. It’s often treated as front-line, low-status work—delegated to junior hires or outsourced to services that never quite deliver. But media monitoring is important—not just for brands tracking name mentions, but also for those who want a curated sense of what’s unfolding in a space.

Despite a wave of tools promising to “cut through the noise,” the reality is: keeping track of meaningful developments in real time is still a challenge. Filtering has improved, but the experience hasn’t.

## Reimagining the Process

The idea I’ve been playing with is this:

If searching keywords on Google or scrolling SEO dashboards feels mind-numbing (unless you're a true SEO obsessive), why not design something closer to a **conversation**?

Think about how engaging it is to talk with a well-informed friend about trends in their field—someone immersed, or someone with insider access, like a journalist. These conversations help you make sense of narratives and changes. They’re dynamic, contextual, and often even enjoyable.

What if large language models could simulate that kind of dialogue? What if media monitoring became less of a chore—and more of an engaging, even fun, daily practice?

## My Use Case and Frustrations

I’ve experimented with a few configurations already. For example, I tried basic media monitoring prompts with **Perplexity Sonar**, and the limitations were immediately clear. Asking Sonar to summarize “what’s happening in AI today” is basically a one-shot prompt—it doesn't cut through the noise meaningfully, and it lacks memory or contextual flow.

This is why I believe **conversational interfaces** matter.

They allow users to refine the scope. To say: “Ignore that. Focus here.” To shape the discovery process. To let nuance build up across a session, not vanish after each input.

And yet, most modern agent frameworks have moved away from this. Front-ends for conversation are rare. Instructional or code-style interactions dominate. But conversations offer one critical edge: a **tight feedback loop**.

In this case, they help you steer quickly toward what matters.

## Why I'm Building This

Partly, it’s out of necessity: I have to do media monitoring for my job.

But I’m also increasingly interested in staying current on domains like AI systems and agent tech—and traditional tracking methods don’t cut it. I believe media monitoring could be one of the most compelling use cases for **speech-to-speech models** in particular.

Because reading daily summaries in text? Still feels like work.

But talking through the news—while on a walk, for example—opens up a different cognitive space. A more relaxed, possibly more creative way of absorbing and connecting ideas.

## Challenges and Conceptual Design

Of course, building this properly poses serious challenges:

- You need a model with strong general reasoning.
- It must have access to timely, accurate information.
- The speech-to-speech interface must be fluid, natural, and affordable.
- And you need a front-end—something real, not just a prototype—that actually lets all this happen.

If those hurdles can be overcome, then the system prompt might look something like this:

---

**System Prompt**  
*You are a diligent research assistant. Your task is to help the user monitor media developments in a specific domain. Unless otherwise specified, assume the user is interested in a retrospective time window of the past few days.*

*Engage the user to understand the kinds of developments they care about. You may also take a proactive role and brief them on what's happened lately. Frame your insights based on what you learn about the user’s interests.*

*When you provide stories, offer links for follow-up reading. If tools are available, email those links to the user.*

*Continue gathering and summarizing relevant information until the user says they’re satisfied. At that point, roll up the findings into a single brief—either shared in the chat or sent via email.*
 

 A **system card** is a structured document that describes how an AI system behaves, what it does, and how it should be used. Originally formalized by OpenAI and other labs to encourage transparency, the format is now widely used in open source AI and agentic projects to document the intent, design, limitations, and usage of system prompts or agents.

Think of a system card as a *spec sheet + README + ethical/functional considerations* for a single AI assistant or tool configuration.

Here’s a tailored system card based on your concept:

#  System Card: Conversational Media Monitor

## Summary

A conversational assistant designed to help users monitor news and media developments in a specific domain. The assistant mimics the experience of talking with a well-informed friend or journalist, guiding users through noteworthy events, stories, and narratives as they unfold—without requiring keyword searches or RSS feeds.

This configuration prioritizes conversation, relevance, and user-driven refinement over one-shot summaries or dashboards.

---

## Intended Use

- **Primary users:** Communications professionals, analysts, researchers, founders, or anyone needing to stay current on evolving topics.
- **Primary task:** Curate and deliver a digest of meaningful news via ongoing conversation.
- **Interface:** Designed for conversational use (text or speech-to-speech), not for one-shot prompts or dashboards.

---

## Interaction Design

### Prompt Style:
```plaintext
You are a diligent research assistant. Your job is to help the user monitor developments in a domain of their choosing. Begin by asking what topics they care about. Unless otherwise specified, focus on stories from the past few days.

Engage in dialogue to learn what the user finds valuable. Be proactive in sharing relevant developments. When offering stories, summarize key points and optionally link to the source. If a tool allows, you may also send the summary via email.

Repeat this process until the user confirms they have what they need. Then, provide a final news brief summarizing the conversation.
```

---

## Key Capabilities

- **Conversational guidance**: The assistant adapts to the user’s interests in real time.
- **Narrative framing**: Highlights not just events, but emerging patterns and tensions.
- **Iterative refinement**: User feedback is incorporated on the fly to improve relevance.
- **Lightweight reporting**: Produces a final summary or news brief on request.

---

## Optional Enhancements

- **Speech interface**: Optimized for voice input/output to support use during walks or casual review.
- **Email integration**: Can send links or final briefs via email.
- **Domain-specific tuning**: Can be scoped to verticals (e.g., climate, AI, finance).

---

## Limitations

- **Not a real-time search engine**: It relies on models that may not have perfect coverage or precision.
- **Requires good model grounding**: Performance depends on models with access to fresh data (e.g., via RAG or integrated browsing).
- **Does not replace strategic media analysis**: The assistant is a filter, not an analyst.

---

## Why It Matters

Traditional media monitoring is inefficient, uninspired, and often demoralizing. By turning this into a fluid, conversational experience, we make it easier to absorb what matters—and to **think through** the media narrative rather than just passively collect it.

This assistant reframes media monitoring as a human dialogue rather than a data slog. It helps users move from fragmented feeds to meaningful synthesis.
